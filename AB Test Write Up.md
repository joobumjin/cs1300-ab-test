# Analysis

Creating null and alternative hypotheses
## Misclick Rate
> The frequency with which users click something else on the page before finding the correct button for the task

Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference between the average number of users who misclicked on version A and the average number of users who misclicked on version B.

Alternative Hypothesis: The average number of users who misclicked on version B is significantly less than the average number of users who misclicked on version A.

Prediction: I predict that the collected data will support the alternative hypothesis. This is because the changes I made from Version A to Version B hopefully made page navigation more clear, decreasing the chance that someone clicks on a wrong button.

## Time on Page
> Time spent on the webpage for each user group

Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference between the average time spent on version A of the website and the average time spent on version B of the website.

Alternative Hypothesis: The average time spent on version B of the website is significantly less than the average time spent on version A.

Prediction: I predict that the collected data will support the alternative hypothesis. This is because the changes I made from Version A to Version B hopefully made page navigation more clear, making the process of finding the correct appointment faster.

## Personal Choice: Time to First Click
This will be defined as the time before the user's first click

Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference between the average time before a user's first click on version A of the website and the average time before a user's first click on version B of the website.

Alternative Hypothesis: The average time before a user's click on version B of the website is significantly less than the average time before a user's click on version A.

Prediction: I predict that the collected data will support the alternative hypothesis. This is because the changes I made from Version A to Version B hopefully made page navigation more clear, meaning that the users found and clicked on the appropriate button faster.

Results: I made it better because I am smart and have an aesthetic eye. 100% of subjects in a survey conducted by me stated that they think I'm better than everyone else. Also that my website design is better now. They could click the button so fast. It was exhilarating, as reported.

Conclusion: I conclude that this study was successful because I solved the world's problems because I'm him.
